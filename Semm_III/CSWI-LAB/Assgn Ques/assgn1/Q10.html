	<center><h1><em><b>S = vᵢt + ½at²: The Equation of Linear Motion</b></em></h1></center>
	<p>The formula S = vᵢt + ½at² describes the motion of an object under constant
acceleration. Here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <i>S</i> represents the displacement,</li>
		<li> <i>vᵢ</i> is the initial velocity</li>
		<li> o <i>t</i> is the time</li>
		<li> <i>a</i> is the acceleration, and</li>
		<li> <i>½at²</i> is the additional displacement due to acceleration.</li>
	</ul>
	<q>An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an <u>external force</u>.</q>
	<p><b>Note:</b> This equation was originally written in 1905.</p>
